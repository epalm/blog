Hey, I'm Eric, a software developer living near Toronto, Canada. I'll mostly be using this blog to write tutorials about code I find useful and/or interesting.

If you find any errors in my posts, or just want to talk about their contents, you can get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epalm). I'm also on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/466011/epalm), [GitHub](https://github.com/epalm), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com/epalm), and [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/epalm).
